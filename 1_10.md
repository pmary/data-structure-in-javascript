# 1.10 Input and Output

We often have a need to interact with users, either to get data or to provide some sort of result. Most of the time we use an HTML form as a way of asking the user to provide some type of input. In our case, we will avoid this and use much simpler functions.

## 1.10.1 Client side
JavaScript provides us with a function that allows us to ask a user to enter some data and returns a reference to the data in the form of a string. The function is called `prompt()`.

A prompt dialog contains a single-line textbox, a Cancel button, and an OK button, and returns the (possibly empty) text the user entered into that textbox.

```javascript
var fruit = prompt("What's your favorite fruit?");

if (fruit.toLowerCase() == "apple") {
  alert("Wow! I love apples too!");
}
```

## 1.10.2 Server side (Node.js)
On the server, we need to use the `readline` module. It provides an interface for reading data from a Readable stream (such as process.stdin) one line at a time.

```javascript
const readline = require('readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

rl.question("What's your favorite fruit? ", (answer) => {

  if (answer.toLowerCase() == "apple") {
    console.log("Wow! I love apples too!");
  }

  rl.close();
});
```

_Note_ Once this code is invoked, the Node.js application will not terminate until the readline interface is closed because the interface waits for data to be received on the input stream.

## 1.10.3 String Formatting
As you may know, `console.log()` function provides a very simple way to output values from a JavaScript program.

> This feature is non-standard so don't use it in production.

`console.log` takes zero or more parameters and displays them using a single blank as separator.
