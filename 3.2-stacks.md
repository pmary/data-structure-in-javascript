# 3.2 Stacks

A stack \(sometimes called a "push-down stack"\) is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. This end is commonly referred to as the "top". The end opposite the top is known as the "base".

The base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack that are closer to the base represent those that have been in the stack the longest. The most recently added item is the one that is in position to be removed first. This ordering principle is sometimes called **LIFO**, **last-in first-out**. It provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection. Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base.

Many examples of stacks occur in everyday situations. Almost any cafeteria has a stack of trays or plates where you take the one at the top, uncovering a new tray or plate for the next customer in line. Imagine a stack of books on a desk. The only book whose cover is visible is the one on top. To access others in the stack, we need to remove the ones that are sitting on top of them.

One of the most useful ideas related to stacks comes from the simple observation of items as they are added and then removed. Assume you start out with a clean desktop. Now place books one at a time on top of each other. You are constructing a stack. Consider what happens when you begin removing books. The order that they are removed is exactly the reverse of the order that they were placed. Stacks are fundamentally important, as they can be used to reverse the order of items. The order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal.

Considering this reversal property, you can perhaps think of examples of stacks that occur as you use your computer. For example, every web browser has a Back button. As you navigate from web page to web page, those pages are placed on a stack \(actually it is the URLs that are going on the stack\). The current page that you are viewing is on the top and the first page you looked at is at the base. If you click on the Back button, you begin to move in reverse order through the pages.

## 3.2.1 The Stack Abstract Data Type

The stack abstract data type is defined by the following structure and operations. A stack is structured, as described above, as an ordered collection of items where items are added to and removed from the end called the "top". Stacks are ordered LIFO. The stack operations are given below.

* `Stack()` creates a new stack that is empty. It needs no parameters and returns an empty stack.
* `push(item)` adds a new item to the top of the stack. It needs the item and returns nothing.
* `pop()` removes the top item from the stack and returns that element. It needs no parameters and returns the item. The stack is modified.
* `peek()` returns the top item from the stack but does not remove it. It needs no parameters. The stack is not modified.
* `isEmpty()` tests to see whether the stack is empty. It needs no parameters and returns a boolean value.
* `size()` returns the number of items on the stack. It needs no parameters and returns an integer.

For example, if s is a stack that has been created and starts out empty, then the table below shows the results of a sequence of stack operations. Under stack contents, the top item is listed at the far right.

| **Stack Operation** | **Stack Contents** | **Return Value** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| s.isEmpty\(\) | \[ \] | true |
| s.push\(4\) | \[4\] |  |
| s.push\('banana'\) | \[4, 'banana'\] |  |
| s.peek\(\) | \[4, 'banana'\] | 'banana' |
| s.push\(true\) | \[4, 'banana', true\] |  |
| s.size\(\) | \[4, 'banana', true\] | 3 |
| s.isEmpty\(\) | \[4, 'banana', true\] | false |
| s.push\(8.4\) | \[4, 'banana', true, 8.4\] |  |
| s.pop\(\) | \[4, 'banana', true\] | 8.4 |
| s.pop\(\) | \[4, 'banana'\] | true |
| s.size\(\) | \[4, 'banana'\] | 2 |

## 3.2.2 A Stack Implementation

Now that we have clearly defined the stack as an abstract data type we will turn our attention to using JavaScript to implement the stack. Recall that when we give an abstract data type a physical implementation we refer to the implementation as a data structure.

As we described earlier, in JavaScript, as in any object-oriented programming language, the implementation of choice for an abstract data type such as a stack is the creation of a new class. The stack operations are implemented as methods. Further, to implement a stack, which is a collection of elements, it makes sense to utilize the power and simplicity of the array provided by JavaScript.

Recall that the arrays in JavaScript are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. For exemple, if we have the list \[2,5,3,6,7,4\], we can use the array `reverse()` method to change which end of the list will be considered the top of the stack and which will be the base. Once that decision is made, the operations can be implemented using the list methods such as `append` and `pop`.

The following stack implementation assumes that the end of the list will hold the top element of the stack. As the stack grows \(as `push` operations occur\), new items will be added on the end of the list. `pop` operations will manipulate that same end.

```js
class Stack {
    constructor() {
        this.items = [];
    }

    isEmpty() {
         return !Boolean(this.items.length); // equivalent to `!!this.items.length`
     }

     push(item) {
         this.items[this.items.length] = item;
     }

     pop() {
         return this.items.pop();
     }

     peek() {
         return this.items[this.items.length-1];
     }

     size() {
         return this.items.length;
     }
}
```

Now we can create a `Stack` object and use it and perform the sequence of operations from first table. Notice that the definition of the Stack class is imported as a JavaScript module.

```js
import Stack from './stack.js';

var s = new Stack();
console.log( s.isEmpty() ); // true
s.push(4);
s.push('banana');
console.log( s.peek() ); // banana
s.push(true);
console.log( s.size() ); // 3
console.log( s.isEmpty() ); // false
s.push(8.4);
console.log( s.pop() ); // 8.4
console.log( s.pop() ); // true
console.log( s.size() ); // 2
```

It is important to note that we could have chosen to implement the stack using a list where the top is at the beginning instead of at the end. In this case, the previous `pop` and `append` methods would no longer work and we would have to index position 0 \(the first item in the list\) explicitly using `pop` and `insert`.

```js
class Stack {
    constructor() {
        this.items = [];
    }

    isEmpty() {
         return !Boolean(this.items.length); // equivalent to `!!this.items.length`
     }

     push(item) {
         this.items.splice(0, 0, item);
     }

     pop() {
         return this.items.shift();
     }

     peek() {
         return this.items[0];
     }

     size() {
         return this.items.length;
     }
}
```

This ability to change the physical implementation of an abstract data type while maintaining the logical characteristics is an example of abstraction at work. However, even though the stack will work either way, if we consider the performance of the two implementations, there is definitely a difference. Recall that the manual assignation and `pop()` operations were both $$O(1)$$. This means that the first implementation will perform `push` and `pop` in constant time no matter how many items are on the stack. The performance of the second implementation suffers in that the `splice` and `shift` operations will both require $$O(n)$$ for a stack of size n. The reason is that `shift()` has to re-index the whole array while `pop()` doesn't. For splice, is going to vary a lot between implementations \(e.g., vendors\). Clearly, even though the implementations are logically equivalent, they would have very different timings when performing benchmark testing.

## 3.2.3. Simple Balanced Parentheses

We now turn our attention to using stacks to solve real computer science problems. You have no doubt written arithmetic expressions such as $$(5+6)*(7+8)/(4+3)$$ where parentheses are used to order the performance of operations.

In these example, parentheses must appear in a balanced fashion. **Balanced parentheses** means that each opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol and the pairs of parentheses are properly nested. The ability to differentiate between parentheses that are correctly balanced and those that are unbalanced is an important part of recognizing many programming language structures.

The challenge then is to write an algorithm that will read a string of parentheses from left to right and decide whether the symbols are balanced. To solve this problem we need to make an important observation. As you process symbols from left to right, the most recent opening parenthesis must match the next closing symbol. Also, the first opening symbol processed may have to wait until the very last symbol for its match. Closing symbols match opening symbols in the reverse order of their appearance; they match from the inside out. This is a clue that stacks can be used to solve the problem.

Once you agree that a stack is the appropriate data structure for keeping the parentheses, the statement of the algorithm is straightforward.
