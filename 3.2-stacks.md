# Stacks

A stack \(sometimes called a "push-down stack"\) is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. This end is commonly referred to as the "top". The end opposite the top is known as the "base".

The base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack that are closer to the base represent those that have been in the stack the longest. The most recently added item is the one that is in position to be removed first. This ordering principle is sometimes called **LIFO**, **last-in first-out**. It provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection. Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base.

Many examples of stacks occur in everyday situations. Almost any cafeteria has a stack of trays or plates where you take the one at the top, uncovering a new tray or plate for the next customer in line. Imagine a stack of books on a desk. The only book whose cover is visible is the one on top. To access others in the stack, we need to remove the ones that are sitting on top of them.
