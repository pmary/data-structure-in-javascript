# 3.2 Stacks

A stack \(sometimes called a "push-down stack"\) is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. This end is commonly referred to as the "top". The end opposite the top is known as the "base".

The base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack that are closer to the base represent those that have been in the stack the longest. The most recently added item is the one that is in position to be removed first. This ordering principle is sometimes called **LIFO**, **last-in first-out**. It provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection. Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base.

Many examples of stacks occur in everyday situations. Almost any cafeteria has a stack of trays or plates where you take the one at the top, uncovering a new tray or plate for the next customer in line. Imagine a stack of books on a desk. The only book whose cover is visible is the one on top. To access others in the stack, we need to remove the ones that are sitting on top of them.

One of the most useful ideas related to stacks comes from the simple observation of items as they are added and then removed. Assume you start out with a clean desktop. Now place books one at a time on top of each other. You are constructing a stack. Consider what happens when you begin removing books. The order that they are removed is exactly the reverse of the order that they were placed. Stacks are fundamentally important, as they can be used to reverse the order of items. The order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal.

Considering this reversal property, you can perhaps think of examples of stacks that occur as you use your computer. For example, every web browser has a Back button. As you navigate from web page to web page, those pages are placed on a stack \(actually it is the URLs that are going on the stack\). The current page that you are viewing is on the top and the first page you looked at is at the base. If you click on the Back button, you begin to move in reverse order through the pages.

## 3.2.1 The Stack Abstract Data Type

The stack abstract data type is defined by the following structure and operations. A stack is structured, as described above, as an ordered collection of items where items are added to and removed from the end called the "top". Stacks are ordered LIFO. The stack operations are given below.

* `Stack()` creates a new stack that is empty. It needs no parameters and returns an empty stack.
* `push(item)` adds a new item to the top of the stack. It needs the item and returns nothing.
* `pop()` removes the top item from the stack and returns that element. It needs no parameters and returns the item. The stack is modified.
* `peek()` returns the top item from the stack but does not remove it. It needs no parameters. The stack is not modified.
* `isEmpty()` tests to see whether the stack is empty. It needs no parameters and returns a boolean value.
* `size()` returns the number of items on the stack. It needs no parameters and returns an integer.

For example, if s is a stack that has been created and starts out empty, then the table below shows the results of a sequence of stack operations. Under stack contents, the top item is listed at the far right.

| **Stack Operation** | **Stack Contents** | **Return Value** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| s.isEmpty\(\) | \[ \] | true |
| s.push\(4\) | \[4\] |  |
| s.push\('banana'\) | \[4, 'banana'\] |  |
| s.peek\(\) | \[4, 'banana'\] | 'banana' |
| s.push\(true\) | \[4, 'banana', true\] |  |
| s.size\(\) | \[4, 'banana', true\] | 3 |
| s.isEmpty\(\) | \[4, 'banana', true\] | false |
| s.push\(8.4\) | \[4, 'banana', true, 8.4\] |  |
| s.pop\(\) | \[4, 'banana', true\] | 8.4 |
| s.pop\(\) | \[4, 'banana'\] | true |
| s.size\(\) | \[4, 'banana'\] | 2 |

## 3.2.2 A Stack Implementation

Now that we have clearly defined the stack as an abstract data type we will turn our attention to using JavaScript to implement the stack. Recall that when we give an abstract data type a physical implementation we refer to the implementation as a data structure.

As we described earlier, in JavaScript, as in any object-oriented programming language, the implementation of choice for an abstract data type such as a stack is the creation of a new class. The stack operations are implemented as methods. Further, to implement a stack, which is a collection of elements, it makes sense to utilize the power and simplicity of the array provided by JavaScript.

Recall that the arrays in JavaScript are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. For exemple, if we have the list \[2,5,3,6,7,4\], we can use the array `reverse()` method to change which end of the list will be considered the top of the stack and which will be the base. Once that decision is made, the operations can be implemented using the list methods such as `append` and `pop`.

The following stack implementation assumes that the end of the list will hold the top element of the stack. As the stack grows \(as `push` operations occur\), new items will be added on the end of the list. `pop` operations will manipulate that same end.

```js
class Stack {
    constructor() {
        this.items = [];
    }

    isEmpty() {
         return !Boolean(this.items.length); // equivalent to `!!this.items.length`
     }

     push(item) {
         this.items[this.items.length] = item;
     }

     pop() {
         return this.items.pop();
     }

     peek() {
         return this.items[this.items.length-1];
     }

     size() {
         return this.items.length;
     }
}
```

Now we can create a `Stack` object and use it and perform the sequence of operations from first table. Notice that the definition of the Stack class is imported as a JavaScript module.

```js
import Stack from './stack.js';

var s = new Stack();
console.log( s.isEmpty() ); // true
s.push(4);
s.push('banana');
console.log( s.peek() ); // banana
s.push(true);
console.log( s.size() ); // 3
console.log( s.isEmpty() ); // false
s.push(8.4);
console.log( s.pop() ); // 8.4
console.log( s.pop() ); // true
console.log( s.size() ); // 2
```

It is important to note that we could have chosen to implement the stack using a list where the top is at the beginning instead of at the end. In this case, the previous `pop` and `append` methods would no longer work and we would have to index position 0 \(the first item in the list\) explicitly using `pop` and `insert`.

```js
class Stack {
    constructor() {
        this.items = [];
    }

    isEmpty() {
         return !Boolean(this.items.length); // equivalent to `!!this.items.length`
     }

     push(item) {
         this.items.splice(0, 0, item);
     }

     pop() {
         return this.items.shift();
     }

     peek() {
         return this.items[0];
     }

     size() {
         return this.items.length;
     }
}

export default Stack;
```

This ability to change the physical implementation of an abstract data type while maintaining the logical characteristics is an example of abstraction at work. However, even though the stack will work either way, if we consider the performance of the two implementations, there is definitely a difference. Recall that the manual assignation and `pop()` operations were both $$O(1)$$. This means that the first implementation will perform `push` and `pop` in constant time no matter how many items are on the stack. The performance of the second implementation suffers in that the `splice` and `shift` operations will both require $$O(n)$$ for a stack of size n. The reason is that `shift()` has to re-index the whole array while `pop()` doesn't. For splice, is going to vary a lot between implementations \(e.g., vendors\). Clearly, even though the implementations are logically equivalent, they would have very different timings when performing benchmark testing.

## 3.2.3 Simple Balanced Parentheses

We now turn our attention to using stacks to solve real computer science problems. You have no doubt written arithmetic expressions such as $$(5+6)*(7+8)/(4+3)$$ where parentheses are used to order the performance of operations.

In these example, parentheses must appear in a balanced fashion. **Balanced parentheses** means that each opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol and the pairs of parentheses are properly nested. The ability to differentiate between parentheses that are correctly balanced and those that are unbalanced is an important part of recognizing many programming language structures.

The challenge then is to write an algorithm that will read a string of parentheses from left to right and decide whether the symbols are balanced. To solve this problem we need to make an important observation. As you process symbols from left to right, the most recent opening parenthesis must match the next closing symbol. Also, the first opening symbol processed may have to wait until the very last symbol for its match. Closing symbols match opening symbols in the reverse order of their appearance; they match from the inside out. This is a clue that stacks can be used to solve the problem.

Once you agree that a stack is the appropriate data structure for keeping the parentheses, the statement of the algorithm is straightforward. Starting with an empty stack, process the parenthesis strings from left to right. If a symbol is an opening parenthesis, push it on the stack as a signal that a corresponding closing symbol needs to appear later. If, on the other hand, a symbol is a closing parenthesis, pop the stack. As long as it is possible to pop the stack to match every closing symbol, the parentheses remain balanced. If at any time there is no opening symbol on the stack to match a closing symbol, the string is not balanced properly. At the end of the string, when all symbols have been processed, the stack should be empty. The Python code to implement this algorithm is shown below.

```js
import Stack from './stack.js';

function parChecker(symbolString) {
    var s = new Stack();
    var balanced = true;
    var index = 0;

    while (index < symbolString.length && balanced) {
        var symbol = symbolString[index];
        if (symbol == '(') {
            s.push(symbol);
        }
        else {
            if (s.isEmpty()) {
                balanced = false;
            }
            else {
                s.pop();
            }
        }
        index = index + 1;
    }

    if (balanced && s.isEmpty()) {
        return true;
    }
    else {
        return false;
    }
}

console.log( parChecker('((()))') ); // true
console.log( parChecker('(()') ); // false
```

This function, `parChecker`, assumes that a `Stack` class is available and returns a boolean result as to whether the string of parentheses is balanced. Note that the boolean variable balanced is initialized to `true` as there is no reason to assume otherwise at the start. If the current symbol is `(`, then it is pushed on the stack \(10\). Note also in line 17 that `pop` simply removes a symbol from the stack. The returned value is not used since we know it must be an opening symbol seen earlier. At the end \(lines 22–27\), as long as the expression is balanced and the stack has been completely cleaned off, the string represents a correctly balanced sequence of parentheses.

## 3.2.4 Balanced Symbols \(A General Case\)

The balanced parentheses problem shown above is a specific case of a more general situation that arises in many programming languages. The general problem of balancing and nesting different kinds of opening and closing symbols occurs frequently. For example, in JavaScript square brackets, `[` and `]`, are used for arrays; curly braces, `{` and `}`, are used for objects; and parentheses, `(` and `)`, are used for tuples and arithmetic expressions. It is possible to mix symbols as long as each maintains its own open and close relationship. Strings of symbols such as the following are properly balanced in that not only does each opening symbol have a corresponding closing symbol, but the types of symbols match as well.

```
{ { ( [ ] [ ] ) } ( ) }

[ [ { { ( ( ) ) } } ] ]

[ ] [ ] [ ] ( ) { }
```

Compare those with the following strings that are not balanced:

```
( [ ) ]

( ( ( ) ] ) )

[ { ( ) ]
```

The simple parentheses checker from the previous section can easily be extended to handle these new types of symbols. Recall that each opening symbol is simply pushed on the stack to wait for the matching closing symbol to appear later in the sequence. When a closing symbol does appear, the only difference is that we must check to be sure that it correctly matches the type of the opening symbol on top of the stack. If the two symbols do not match, the string is not balanced. Once again, if the entire string is processed and nothing is left on the stack, the string is correctly balanced.

The JavaScript program to implement this is shown below:

```js
import Stack from './stack.js';

function parChecker(symbolString) {
    var s = new Stack();
    var balanced = true;
    var index = 0;
    var openingSymbols = ['(', '[', '{'];

    while (index < symbolString.length && balanced) {
        var symbol = symbolString[index];
        if (openingSymbols.includes(symbol)) {
            s.push(symbol);
        }
        else {
            if (s.isEmpty()) {
                balanced = false;
            }
            else {
                var top = s.pop();
                if (!matches(top, symbol)) {
                    balanced = false;
                }
            }
        }
        index = index + 1;
    }

    if (balanced && s.isEmpty()) {
        return true;
    }
    else {
        return false;
    }
}

function matches(open, close) {
    opens = ['(', '[', '{'];
    closers = [')', ']', '}'];
    return opens.indexOf(open) === closers.indexOf(close);
}

console.log( '{ { ( [ ] [ ] ) } ( ) }' ); // true
console.log( '( [ ) ]' ); // false
```

> The `includes()` is a new method introduced by the ECMAScript 2016. It determine whether an array includes a certain element, returning `true` or `false` as appropriate.

The only change appears in line 20 where we call a helper function, `matches`, to assist with symbol-matching. Each symbol that is removed from the stack must be checked to see that it matches the current closing symbol. If a mismatch occurs, the boolean variable `balanced` is set to `false`.

These two examples show that stacks are very important data structures for the processing of language constructs in computer science. Almost any notation you can think of has some type of nested symbol that must be matched in a balanced order. There are a number of other important uses for stacks in computer science. We will continue to explore them in the next sections.

## 3.2.4 Converting Decimal Numbers to Binary Numbers

In your study of computer science, you have probably been exposed in one way or another to the idea of a binary number. Binary representation is important in computer science since all values stored within a computer exist as a string of binary digits, a string of 0s and 1s. Without the ability to convert back and forth between common representations and binary numbers, we would need to interact with computers in very awkward ways.

Integer values are common data items. They are used in computer programs and computation all the time. We learn about them in math class and of course represent them using the decimal number system, or base 10. The decimal number $$233_{10}$$ and its corresponding binary equivalent $$11101001_{2}$$ are interpreted respectively as $$2\times10^{2} + 3\times10^{1} + 3\times10^{0}$$ and $$1\times2^{7} + 1\times2^{6} + 1\times2^{5} + 0\times2^{4} + 1\times2^{3} + 0\times2^{2} + 0\times2^{1} + 1\times2^{0}$$.

But how can we easily convert integer values into binary numbers? The answer is an algorithm called “Divide by 2” that uses a stack to keep track of the digits for the binary result.
