# Analysis

## Objectives

* To understand why algorithm analysis is important.
* To be able to use "Big-O" to describe execution time.
* To understand the “Big-O” execution time of common operations on JavaScript arrays and objects.
* To understand how the implementation of JavaScript data impacts algorithm analysis.

* To understand how to benchmark simple JavaScript programs.
