# 1.14 Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript: Defining Classes

Object-oriented to the core, JavaScript features powerful, flexible OOP capabilities. So far, we have used a number of built-in classes to show examples of data and control structures. One of the most powerful features in an object-oriented programming language is the ability to allow a programmer \(problem solver\) to create new classes that model data that is needed to solve the problem.

Remember that we use abstract data types to provide the logical description of what a data object looks like \(its state\) and what it can do \(its methods\). By building a class that implements an abstract data type, a programmer can take advantage of the abstraction process and at the same time provide the details necessary to actually use the abstraction in a program. Whenever we want to implement an abstract data type, we will do so with a new class.

## 1.14.1. A Fraction Class

A very common example to show the details of implementing a user-defined class is to construct a class to implement the abstract data type `Fraction`.
