# 1.11 Control Structures

Algorithms require two important control structures: iteration and selection. Both of these are supported by JavaScript in various forms. The programmer can choose the statement that is most useful for the given circumstance.

For iteration, JavaScript provides a standard while statement and a very powerful for statement. 

## 1.11.1 Iteration

### while loop

The while statement repeats a body of code as long as the condition is true.

```javascript
var counter = 0;
while (counter < 3) {
  console.log('Counter at', counter);
  counter = counter + 1;
}
// Counter at 0
// Counter at 1
// Counter at 2
```

The condition on the while statement is evaluated at the start of each repetition. If the condition is `True`, the body of the statement will execute.

### do...while

In the previous example the statement block was executed only if the condition was true. The `do...while` loop does the opposite

```javascript
var counter = 0;
do {
  console.log('Counter at', counter);
  counter = counter + 1;
} while (counter < 3);
// Counter at 0
// Counter at 1
// Counter at 2
```

The block following `do` is executed first and then the condition is evaluated. If the while condition is true, the block is executed again and repeats until the condition becomes false. This is known as a _post-test_ loop as the condition is evaluated after the block has executed.

### for loop
Another iterative structure, the `for` statement, can be used to iterate over the members of any object.

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
   console.log(i);
}
```

### for-in loop
