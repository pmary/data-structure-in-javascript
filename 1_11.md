# 1.11 Control Structures

Algorithms require two important control structures: iteration and selection. Both of these are supported by JavaScript in various forms. The programmer can choose the statement that is most useful for the given circumstance.

For iteration, JavaScript provides a standard `while` statement and a very powerful `for` statement. 

## 1.11.1 Iteration

### while loop

The while statement repeats a body of code as long as the condition is true.

```javascript
var counter = 0;
while (counter < 3) {
  console.log('Counter at', counter);
  counter = counter + 1;
}
// Counter at 0
// Counter at 1
// Counter at 2
```

The condition on the while statement is evaluated at the start of each repetition. If the condition is `True`, the body of the statement will execute.

### do...while

In the previous example the statement block was executed only if the condition was true. The `do...while` loop does the opposite

```javascript
var counter = 0;
do {
  console.log('Counter at', counter);
  counter = counter + 1;
} while (counter < 3);
// Counter at 0
// Counter at 1
// Counter at 2
```

The block following `do` is executed first and then the condition is evaluated. If the while condition is true, the block is executed again and repeats until the condition becomes false. This is known as a _post-test_ loop as the condition is evaluated after the block has executed.

### for loop
The most frequently used loop in JavaScript is the for-loop. It consists of three parts, separated by semicolons. The first is the _initializer_ (var i = 1) which initializes the loop and is executed only once at the start. The second is a _test_ condition (i <= 50). When a conditional expression evaluates to true, the body of the loop is executed. When false, the loop terminates. The third part is an _updater_ (i++) which is invoked after each iteration. The updater typically increments or decrements the loop counter.

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
   console.log(i);
}
// Counter at 0
// Counter at 1
// Counter at 2
```

### for-in loop
A for-in loop iterates through the properties of an object and executes the loop's body once for each enumerable property of the object.

```javascript
var fruit = { name: 'Apple', kingdom: 'Plantae', family: '	Rosaceae' };
for (var item in fruit) {
   console.log(fruit[item]);
}
// Apple
// Plantae
// Rosoceae
```
