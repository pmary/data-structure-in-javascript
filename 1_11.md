# 1.11 Control Structures

Algorithms require two important control structures: iteration and selection. Both of these are supported by JavaScript in various forms. The programmer can choose the statement that is most useful for the given circumstance.

For iteration, JavaScript provides a standard while statement and a very powerful for statement. The while statement repeats a body of code as long as a condition is true.

```javascript
var counter = 0;
while (counter < 3) {
  console.log('Counter at', counter);
  counter = counter + 1;
}
// Counter at 0
// Counter at 1
// Counter at 2
```

The condition on the while statement is evaluated at the start of each repetition. If the condition is `True`, the body of the statement will execute.

Another iterative structure, the `for` statement, can be used to iterate over the members of any object.

```javascript

for (var i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
   console.log(i);
}
```
