# 1.1 Why this book?

As a curious JavaScript developer, I was an early adopter of NodeJS. As I was moving to server-side programming, I need to implement data structures like linked lists, stacks and queues and there associated algorithms. Since I am an autodidact without computer science degree, I encountered several issues. Back in 2009, they was nothing about data structure in JavaScript so I have to study it in classic object-oriented languages like Java and C#. Today, things are slowly changing. But I still see many JavaScript developer moving to the server-side, don't know nothing about data structures and why studying them is important.
Through this guide, I will explain you what are the different data structures, their usages and implementation for server-side as well as their limitation due to JavaScript.

At the end, you will be able to chose the right data structure for the problems you have to solve.



# 1.3 Defining computer science
Computer science is a discipline that spans theory and practice. In short, it's the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solutions that come out of the problem-solving process. The solution is called an **algorithm**. An algorithm is a step-by-step set of operations for solving a clearly defined problem.

However, consider the fact that some problems may not have a solution. This assumption mean that we have to redefine computer science as the study of solutions to problems as well as the study of problems with no solutions.

As we are talking about computer science as a problem-solving process, it mean we have to approach the study of **abstraction**.
Abstraction allows us to separate problem and solution. Let's illustrate this separation with example:  
Consider the legs that you may use when you wake up the morning and go to the bathroom. You get up and put one foot before the other to your destination with a success conditioned by the level of alcohol you ingested the night before. From an abstraction point of view, we can say that you are seeing the logical perspective of the legs. You are using the functions provided by the evolution for the purpose of transporting you from one location to another. These functions are sometimes also referred to as the interface.

On the other hand, the surgeon who must treat a leg takes a very different point of view. She not only knows how to walk but must know all of the details necessary to carry out all the functions that we take for granted. She needs to understand how the body works, how the blood feeds the muscles, the way nerves transmit impulses from the brain, and so on. This is known as the physical perspective, the details that take place “under the hood.”

The same thing happens when we use computers. Most people use computers to surf the web, send and receive emails, without any knowledge of the details that take place to allow those types of applications to work. They view computers from a logical or user perspective. Peoples behind the scene take a very different view of the computer. They must know the details of how operating systems work, how network protocols are configured, and how to code various scripts that control function. They must be able to control the low-level details that a user simply assumes.

As another example of abstraction, consider the math.js library. Once we import the module, we can perform computations such as

```javascript
import math from mathjs

math.sqrt(-4);                    // 2i
```

This is an example of **procedural abstraction**. We do not necessarily know how the square root is being calculated, but we know what the function is called and how to use it. If we perform the import correctly, we can assume that the function will provide us with the correct results. We know that someone implemented a solution to the square root problem but we only need to know how to use it. This is sometimes referred to as a “black box” view of a process. We simply describe the interface: the name of the function, what is needed (the parameters), and what will be returned.

# 1.4 Defining programming 

**Programming** is the process of taking an algorithm (the formulation of a computing problem) and encoding it into an executable computer program by using a programming language. Without an algorithm there can be no program.

An algorithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to perform to produce the intended result. It also describe the data needed to represent the problem instance. Programming languages have some primitive building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them.

This control constructs allow algorithmic steps to be represented in a convenient and unambiguous way.   
To be used for algorithm representation a programming language must provide the following basic instructions:
 - Input: Get in data from a keyboard, a file, or another source.
 - Output: Display data on the screen or to a file or by another way.
 - Arithmetic: Perform basic arithmetical operations like addition and multiplication.
 - Conditional Execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.
 - Repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

All data items in the computer are represented as strings of binary digits. In order to give these strings meaning, we need to have **data types**.  
For example, most programming languages provide a data type for integers. Strings of binary digits in the computer’s memory can be interpreted as integers and given the typical meanings that we commonly associate with integers (e.g. 23, 654, and -19). In addition, a data type also provides a description of the operations that the data items can participate in. With integers, operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication are common. We have come to expect that numeric types of data can participate in these arithmetic operations.

Unlike lower-level languages, JavaScript is a loosely typed/dynamic language. That means you don't have to declare the type of a variable ahead of time. The type will get determined automatically while the program is being processed. That also means that you can have the same variable as different types:

```javascript
var foo = 42;    // foo is now a Number
var foo = "bar"; // foo is now a String
var foo = true;  // foo is now a Boolean
```

The difficulty that often arises for us is the fact that problems and their solutions are very complex. These simple, language-provided constructs and data types, although certainly sufficient to represent complex solutions, are typically at a disadvantage as we work through the problem-solving process. We need ways to control this complexity and assist with the creation of solutions.

# 1.5 Why Study Data Structures and Abstract Data Types?

When working on the problem-solving process, we need to stay focus on the big picture and avoid getting lost in the details. Abstractions are the perfect conceptual tool for that by allowing us to create models of the problem domain. A such model describe the data that our algorithms will manipulate. We called it a **data abstraction**.  
An **abstract data type**, or **ADT**, is a logical description of how we view the data and the allowed operations without regard to how they will be implemented. By providing this level of abstraction, we are creating an encapsulation around the data. By encapsulating the details of the implementation, we are hiding them from our view. This is called **information hiding**. This allow us to remain focused on the problem-solving process.  

# 1.6 Why Study Algorithms?
We learn by experience, by solving problems by ourselves or by following examples. With a deep understanding of how algorithms are designed, it helps us to take on the next challenge. We can begin to develop pattern recognition so that the next time a similar problem arises, we are better able to solve it. Just like we must remember the greatest number of combinations possible at cheese.  

For a given problem, let say compute a square root, there is many different ways to implement the solution. We would like to have some way to compare these solutions in terms of time and resource consumption. By studying algorithms, we learn analysis techniques to do so based solely on their own characteristics. It mean separate them from the characteristics of the program or computer used to implement them.  

The worst case scenario is a problem that is intractable. Meaning that there is no algorithm that can solve it in a realistic amount of time. It is important to be able to distinguish between those problems, those that have solutions and those that do not.  

In the end, there are often many ways to solve a problem. There will often be trade-offs that we will need to identify and decide upon. This is a tasks that we will do over and over again.

# 1.7 Review of Basic JavaScript  

In this section, we will review the basis of this programming language. If you are new to JavaScript or need more information, don't hesitate to consult a resource such as the dedicated section on the  [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript). The goal is to familiarize yourself with the language and reinforce the central concepts.

# 1.9 Getting Started with Data  
JavaScript is object-oriented to the core. It means that data is the focal point of the problem-solving process. This is also a prototype-based language and contains no class statement, such as is found in C++ or Java.  

> In JavaScript we don't have to define the type of a variable. This type is deducted from the value stored and may change as the program is running. It is said that JavaScript is a **dynamically** typed language. Other languages like C or Java required the definition of variable types. This is called **static** typing.

## 1.9.1 Built-in Data Types  
According to the latest ECMAScript release, these are the seven data types:  
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Object
- Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6)
- Null
- Undefined

### 1.9.1.1 Primitive values  
#### String   
A String value is a zero or more Unicode characters. They are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form.  

Some of the most-used operations on strings are to check their **length**, to build and concatenate them using the + and **+= string operators**, checking for the existence or location of substrings with the **indexOf()** method, or extracting substrings with the **substring()** method.  

You include string literals in your scripts by enclosing them in single or double quotation marks:  

```javascript
var myVar = 'Hello';
var otherVar = "World";
```  

They can also be created using the String global object directly:  

```javascript
var myVar = String(42);
console.log(myVar); // "42"
```  

#### Number  
In JavaScript, there is no distinction between integer and floating-point values; a JavaScript number can be either (internally, JavaScript represents all numbers as floating-point values).  
The standard arithmetic operations, +, -, \*, and / can be used with parentheses forcing the order of operations away from normal operator precedence.  
Other very useful operation is the remainder (modulo) operator, %.  

> **Good to know**: The exponentiation operator \*\* is part of the ECMAScript 2016 (ES7), finalized in June 2016. It will eventually be implanted in all browsers but for the moment check the support before you use it.  

```javascript
console.log( 2+3*4 ); // 14
console.log( (2+3)*4 ); //20
console.log( 2**10 ); // 1024
console.log( 6/3 ); // 2
console.log( 7/3 ); // 2.3333333333333335
console.log( 7%3 ); // 1
console.log( 3/6 ); // 0.5
console.log( 3%6 ); // 3
console.log( 2**100 ); // 1.2676506002282294e+30
```

#### Boolean  
Pretty standard across all languages, booleans are `true` and `false`. They're often used for conditional statements.

```javascript
var myBool = new Boolean(false);
var myBool2 = true;
```

Since the variable type is dependent to it's value in JavaScript, the following will not be booleans:
```javascript
var notABoolean1 = "true"; //string
var notABoolean2 = 1; //integer
```

#### Symbol  
This is new in ECMAScript 6, there is no EcmaScript 5 equivalent. A Symbol is a primitive data type whose instances are unique and immutable. In some programming languages they are also called atoms.  
With Reflect, and Proxy, Symbol is one of the three new APIs that allow us to do metaprogramming.

You can find more abour symbols on my blog: [Metaprogramming with ES2016 #1 - Symbol](http://pierremary.com/metaprogramming-with-es2016/)

#### Null  
The value null is what you get when a variable has been defined but has no type or value. We can use it for exemple to assign a default value to a new variable: 

```javascript
var fool = null;
console.log(foo); // null
```

#### Undefined  
This is a very specific type returned when a variable is used without being declare before

Unfedefined is a very specific constant that is returned when a variable is not declared or when it is declared with no value assigned.

```javascript
var foo;
console.log(foo); // undefined

console.log(bar); // throws a ReferenceError
```

### 1.9.1.2 Object  
JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.

# 1.10 Input and Output
We often have a need to interact with users, either to get data or to provide some sort of result. Most of the time we use an HTML form as a way of asking the user to provide some type of input. In our case, we will avoid this and use much simpler functions.

## 1.10.1 Client side
JavaScript provides us with a function that allows us to ask a user to enter some data and returns a reference to the data in the form of a string. The function is called `prompt()`.

A prompt dialog contains a single-line textbox, a Cancel button, and an OK button, and returns the (possibly empty) text the user entered into that textbox.

```javascript
var fruit = prompt("What's your favorite fruit?");

if (fruit.toLowerCase() == "apple") {
  alert("Wow! I love apples too!");
}
```

## 1.10.2 Server side (Node.js)
On the server, we need to use the `readline` module. It provides an interface for reading data from a Readable stream (such as process.stdin) one line at a time.

```javascript
const readline = require('readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

rl.question("What's your favorite fruit? ", (answer) => {

  if (answer.toLowerCase() == "apple") {
    console.log("Wow! I love apples too!");
  }

  rl.close();
});
```

_Note_ Once this code is invoked, the Node.js application will not terminate until the readline.Interface is closed because the interface waits for data to be received on the input stream.
