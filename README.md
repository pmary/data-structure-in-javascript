# Why this book?

As a curious JavaScript developer, I was an early adopter of NodeJS. As I was moving to server-side programming, I need to implement data structures like linked lists, stacks and queues and there associated algorithms. Since I am an autodidact without computer science degree, I encountered several issues. Back in 2009, they was nothing about data structure in JavaScript so I have to study it in classic object-oriented languages like Java and C#. Today, things are slowly changing. But I still see many JavaScript developer moving to the server-side, don't know nothing about data structures and why studying them is important.
Through this guide, I will explain you what are the different data structures, their usages and implementation for server-side as well as their limitation due to JavaScript.

At the end, you will be able to chose the right data structure for the problems you have to solve.

# Getting Started
As developers, we are living in a world in rapid evolution. This is especially true in the JavaScript ecosystem and its constant growing number of tools, framworks and platforms. Nonetheless, the basic principles of computer science are still the foundation on which we stand when we use computers to solve problems.

# Defining computer science
Computer science is a discipline that spans theory and practice. In short, it's the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solutions that come out of the problem-solving process. The solution is called an **algorithm**. An algorithm is a step-by-step set of operations for solving a clearly defined problem.

However, consider the fact that some problems may not have a solution. This assumption mean that we have to redifine computer science as the study of solutions to problems as well as the study of problems with no solutions.

As we are talking about computer science as a problem-solving process, it mean we have to approach the study of **abstraction**.
Abstraction allows us to separate problem and solution. Let's illustrate this separation with example:  
Consider the ...
