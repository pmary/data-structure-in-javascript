# 1.1 Why this book?

As a curious JavaScript developer, I was an early adopter of NodeJS. As I was moving to server-side programming, I need to implement data structures like linked lists, stacks and queues and there associated algorithms. Since I am an autodidact without computer science degree, I encountered several issues. Back in 2009, they was nothing about data structure in JavaScript so I have to study it in classic object-oriented languages like Java and C#. Today, things are slowly changing. But I still see many JavaScript developer moving to the server-side, don't know nothing about data structures and why studying them is important.
Through this guide, I will explain you what are the different data structures, their usages and implementation for server-side as well as their limitation due to JavaScript.

At the end, you will be able to chose the right data structure for the problems you have to solve.
