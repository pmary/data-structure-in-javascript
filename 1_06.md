# 1.6 Why Study Algorithms?

We learn by experience, by solving problems by ourselves or by following examples. With a deep understanding of how algorithms are designed, it helps us to take on the next challenge. We can begin to develop pattern recognition so that the next time a similar problem arises, we are better able to solve it. Just like we must remember the greatest number of combinations possible at cheese.  

For a given problem, let say compute a square root, there is many different ways to implement the solution. We would like to have some way to compare these solutions in terms of time and resource consumption. By studying algorithms, we learn analysis techniques to do so based solely on their own characteristics. It mean separate them from the characteristics of the program or computer used to implement them.  

The worst case scenario is a problem that is intractable. Meaning that there is no algorithm that can solve it in a realistic amount of time. It is important to be able to distinguish between those problems, those that have solutions and those that do not.  

In the end, there are often many ways to solve a problem. There will often be trade-offs that we will need to identify and decide upon. This is a tasks that we will do over and over again.
