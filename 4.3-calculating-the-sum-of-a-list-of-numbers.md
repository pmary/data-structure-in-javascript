4.3 Calculating the Sum of a List of Numbers

We will begin our investigation with a simple problem that you already know how to solve without using recursion. Suppose that you want to calculate the sum of a list of numbers such as: \[1, 3, 5, 7, 9\]. We will uses an accumulator variable \(`theSum`\) to compute a running total of all the numbers in the list by starting with 00 and adding each number in the list.

```js
function listSum(numList) {
    var theSum = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < numList.length; i++) {
        theSum += numList[i];
    }
    return theSum;
}

console.log( listSum([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) );
```

Pretend for a minute that you do not have `while` loops or `for` loops. How would you compute the sum of a list of numbers? If you were a mathematician you might start by recalling that addition is a function that is defined for two parameters, a pair of numbers. To redefine the problem from adding a list to adding pairs of numbers, we could rewrite the list as a fully parenthesized expression. Such an expression looks like this: $$((((1 + 3) + 5) + 7) + 9)$$.

We can also parenthesize the expression the other way around: $$(1 + (3 + (5 + (7 + 9))))$$.

Notice that the innermost set of parentheses, \(7+9\), is a problem that we can solve without a loop or any special constructs. In fact, we can use the following sequence of simplifications to compute a final sum.

$$\begin{split}total = \  (1 + (3 + (5 + (7 + 9)))) \\
total = \  (1 + (3 + (5 + 16))) \\
total = \  (1 + (3 + 21)) \\
total = \  (1 + 24) \\
total = \  25\end{split}$$
