# 1.12 Exception Handling

There are two types of errors that typically occur when writing programs. The first is known as a **syntax error**. It means that the programmer has made a mistake in the structure of a statement or expression. For example, not escaping strings properly:

```javascript
var foo = 'Tom's bar';
// Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
```

The other type of error is a logic error, denotes a situation where the program executes but gives the wrong result. This can be due to an error in the underlying algorithm or an error in your translation of that algorithm. In some cases, logic errors lead to very bad situations such as trying to divide by zero or trying to access an item in a list where the index of the item is outside the bounds of the list. In this case, the logic error leads to a runtime error that causes the program to terminate. These types of runtime errors are typically called **exceptions**.

Most of the time, beginning programmers simply think of exceptions as fatal runtime errors that cause the end of execution. However, most programming languages provide a way to deal with these errors that will allow the programmer to have some type of intervention if they so choose. In addition, programmers can create their own exceptions if they detect a situation in the program execution that warrants it.

When an exception occurs, we say that it has been "raised". You can "handle the exception that has been raised by using a `try` statement. For example, consider a program that asks the user for an integer and then calculate its square root. If the user enters a negative value, the square root function will report a 'ValueError' exception.

```javascript
