# 1.12 Exception Handling

There are two types of errors that typically occur when writing programs. The first, known as a syntax error, simply means that the programmer has made a mistake in the structure of a statement or expression. For example, not escaping strings properly:

```javascript
var foo = 'Tom's bar';
// Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
```

The other type of error, known as a logic error, denotes a situation where the program executes but gives the wrong result.
