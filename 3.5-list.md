# 3.5 List

Throughout the discussion of basic data structures, we have used JavaScript array to implement the abstract data types presented. The array is the implementation of a data structure called **list. **This is a powerful, yet simple, collection mechanism that provides the programmer with a wide variety of operations. However, not all programming languages include a list collection. In these cases, the notion of a list must be implemented by the programmer.

A **list **is a collection of items where each item holds a relative position with respect to the others. More specifically, we will refer to this type of list as an unordered list. We can consider the list as having a first item, a second item, a third item, and so on. We can also refer to the beginning of the list \(the first item\) or the end of the list \(the last item\). For simplicity we will assume that lists cannot contain duplicate items.

For example, the collection of integers 54, 26, 93, 17, 77, and 31 might represent a simple unordered list of exam scores. Note that we have written them as comma-delimited values, a common way of showing the list structure. Of course, JavaScript would show this list as \[54,26,93,17,77,31\].

## 3.5.1 The Unordered List Abstract Data Type

The structure of an unordered list, as described above, is a collection of items where each item holds a relative position with respect to the others. Some possible unordered list operations are given below.

* List\(\) create a new list that is empty. It needs no parameters and returns an empty list.
* add\(item\) adds a new item to the list. It needs the item and returns nothing. Assume the item is not already in the list.
* remove\(item\) removes the item from the list. It needs the item and modifies the list. Assume the item is present in the list.
* search\(item\) searches for the item in the list. It needs the item and returns a boolean value.
* isEmpty\(\) tests to see whether the list is empty. It needs no parameters and returns a boolean value.
* size\(\) returns the number of items in the list. It needs no parameters and returns an integer.
* append\(item\) adds a new item to the end of the list making it the last item in the collection. It needs the item and returns nothing. Assume the item is not already in the list.
* index\(item\) returns the position of an item in the list. It needs the item and returns the index. Assume the item is in the list.
* insert\(pos, item\) adds a new item to the list at position pos. It needs the item and the position and returns nothing. Assume the item is not already in the list and there are enough existing items to have position pos.
* pop\(\) removes and returns the last item in the list. It needs nothing and returns an item. Assume the list has at least one item.
* pop\(pos\) removes and returns the item at position pos. It needs the position and returns the item. Assume the item is in the list.
