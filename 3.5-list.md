# 3.5 List

Throughout the discussion of basic data structures, we have used JavaScript array to implement the abstract data types presented. The array is the implementation of a data structure called **list. **This is a powerful, yet simple, collection mechanism that provides the programmer with a wide variety of operations. However, not all programming languages include a list collection. In these cases, the notion of a list must be implemented by the programmer.

A **list **is a collection of items where each item holds a relative position with respect to the others. More specifically, we will refer to this type of list as an unordered list. We can consider the list as having a first item, a second item, a third item, and so on. We can also refer to the beginning of the list \(the first item\) or the end of the list \(the last item\). For simplicity we will assume that lists cannot contain duplicate items.

For example, the collection of integers 54, 26, 93, 17, 77, and 31 might represent a simple unordered list of exam scores. Note that we have written them as comma-delimited values, a common way of showing the list structure. Of course, JavaScript would show this list as \[54,26,93,17,77,31\].

## 3.5.1 The Unordered List Abstract Data Type

The structure of an unordered list, as described above, is a collection of items where each item holds a relative position with respect to the others. Some possible unordered list operations are given below.

* `List()` create a new list that is empty. It needs no parameters and returns an empty list.
* `add(item)` adds a new item to the list. It needs the item and returns nothing. Assume the item is not already in the list.
* `remove(item)` removes the item from the list. It needs the item and modifies the list. Assume the item is present in the list.
* `search(item)` searches for the item in the list. It needs the item and returns a boolean value.
* `isEmpty()` tests to see whether the list is empty. It needs no parameters and returns a boolean value.
* `size()` returns the number of items in the list. It needs no parameters and returns an integer.
* `append(item)` adds a new item to the end of the list making it the last item in the collection. It needs the item and returns nothing. Assume the item is not already in the list.
* `index(item)` returns the position of an item in the list. It needs the item and returns the index. Assume the item is in the list.
* `insert(pos, item)` adds a new item to the list at position pos. It needs the item and the position and returns nothing. Assume the item is not already in the list and there are enough existing items to have position pos.
* `pop()` removes and returns the last item in the list. It needs nothing and returns an item. Assume the list has at least one item.
* `pop(pos)` removes and returns the item at position pos. It needs the position and returns the item. Assume the item is in the list.

## 3.5.2 Implementing an Unordered List: Linked Lists

In order to implement an unordered list, we will construct what is commonly known as a **linked list**. Recall that we need to be sure that we can maintain the relative positioning of the items. However, there is no requirement that we maintain that positioning in contiguous memory. If we can maintain some explicit information in each item, namely the location of the next item, then the relative position of each item can be expressed by simply following the link from one item to the next.

It is important to note that the location of the first item of the list must be explicitly specified. Once we know where the first item is, the first item can tell us where the second is, and so on. The external reference is often referred to as the **head** of the list. Similarly, the last item needs to know that there is no next item.

### 3.5.2.1 The Node Class

The basic building block for the linked list implementation is the **node **.Each node object must hold at least two pieces of information. First, the node must contain the list item itself. We will call this the **data field** of the node. In addition, each node must hold a reference to the next node. To construct a node, you need to supply the initial data value for the node. Evaluating the assignment statement below will yield a node object containing the value 93. The `Node` class also includes the usual methods to access and modify the data and the next reference.

```js
class Node {
    constructor(data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }

    getData() {
        return this.data;
    }

    getNext() {
        return this.next;
    }

    setData(newData) {
        this.data = newData;
    }

    setNext(nextNode) {
        this.next = nextNode;
    }
}

var myNode = new Node(93);
console.log( myNode.getData() ); // 93
```

The JavaScript primitive values `null` will play an important role in the `Node` class and later in the linked list itself. A reference to `null` will denote the fact that there is no next node. Note in the constructor that a node is initially created with `next` set to `null`. This is sometimes referred to as "grounding the node". It is always a good idea to explicitly assign `null` to your initial next reference values.

### 3.5.2.2 The Unordered List Class

As we suggested above, the unordered list will be built from a collection of nodes, each linked to the next by explicit references. As long as we know where to find the first node \(containing the first item\), each item after that can be found by successively following the next links. With this in mind, the `UnorderedList` class must maintain a reference to the first node. Here is the constructor:

```js
class UnorderedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
    }
}

var mylist = new UnorderedList();
```

As we discussed in the Node class, the special reference `null` will again be used to state that the head of the list does not refer to anything. The head of the list refers to the first node which contains the first item of the list. In turn, that node holds a reference to the next node \(the next item\) and so on. It is very important to note that the list class itself does not contain any node objects. Instead it contains a single reference to only the first node in the linked structure.

#### isEmpty\(\)

The `isEmpty` method simply checks to see if the head of the list is a reference to `null`. The result of the boolean expression `this.head === null` will only be true if there are no nodes in the linked list. Since a new list is empty, the constructor and the check for empty must be consistent with one another. This shows the advantage to using the reference `null` to denote the "end" of the linked structure. 

```js
isEmpty() {
    return this.head === null;
}
```

#### add\(\)

So, how do we get items into our list? We need to implement the `add` method. However, before we can do that, we need to address the important question of where in the linked list to place the new item. Since this list is unordered, the specific location of the new item with respect to the other items already in the list is not important. The new item can go anywhere. With that in mind, it makes sense to place the new item in the easiest location possible.

Recall that the linked list structure provides us with only one entry point, the head of the list. All of the other nodes can only be reached by accessing the first node and then following `next` links. This means that the easiest place to add the new node is right at the head, or beginning, of the list. In other words, we will make the new item the first item of the list and the existing items will need to be linked to this new first item so that they follow. Here is the implementation of the `add` method:

```js
add(item) {
    var newNode = new Node(item);
    newNode.setNext(this.head);
    this.head = newNode;
}
```

Each item of the list must reside in a node object. Line 2 creates a new node and places the item as its data. Now we must complete the process by linking the new node into the existing structure. This requires two steps. Step 1 \(line 3\) changes the `next` reference of the new node to refer to the old first node of the list. Now that the rest of the list has been properly attached to the new node, we can modify the head of the list to refer to the new node. The assignment statement in line 4 sets the head of the list.

The order of the two steps described above is very important. What happens if the order of line 3 and line 4 is reversed? If the modification of the head of the list happens first, since the head was the only external reference to the list nodes, all of the original nodes are lost and can no longer be accessed.

Let's build a new list by calling the add method a number of times:

```js
var myList = new UnorderedList();

myList.add(31);
myList.add(77);
myList.add(17);
myList.add(93);
myList.add(26);
myList.add(54);
```

Since 31 is the first item added to the list, it will eventually be the last node on the linked list as every other item is added ahead of it. Also, since 54 is the last item added, it will become the data value in the first node of the linked list.

The next methods that we will implement \(`size`, `search`, and `remove`\) are all based on a technique known as **linked list traversal**. Traversal refers to the process of systematically visiting each node. To do this we use an external reference that starts at the first node in the list. As we visit each node, we move the reference to the next node by "traversing" the next reference.

#### size\(\)

To implement the `size` method, we need to traverse the linked list and keep a count of the number of nodes that occurred.

```js
size() {
    var current = this.head;
    var count = 0;
    while (current !== null) {
        count = count + 1;
        current = current.getNext();
    }

    return count;
}
```

The external reference is called `current` and is initialized to the head of the list in line 2. At the start of the process we have not seen any nodes so the count is set to 0. Lines 4–6 actually implement the traversal. As long as the current reference has not seen the end of the list \(`null`\), we move current along to the next node via the assignment statement in line 6. Every time current moves to a new node, we add 1 to `count`. Finally, `count` gets returned after the iteration stops.

#### search\(\)

Searching for a value in a linked list implementation of an unordered list also uses the traversal technique. As we visit each node in the linked list we will ask whether the data stored there matches the item we are looking for. In this case, however, we may not have to traverse all the way to the end of the list. In fact, if we do get to the end of the list, that means that the item we are looking for must not be present. So, if we do find the item, there is no need to continue.

```js
search(item) {
    var current = this.head;
    var found = false;
    while (current !== null && !found) {
        if (current.getData() === item) {
            found = true;
        }
        else {
            current = current.getNext();
        }
    }

    return found;
}
```

As in the `size` method, the traversal is initialized to start at the head of the list \(line 2\). We also use a boolean variable called `found` to remember whether we have located the item we are searching for. Since we have not found the item at the start of the traversal, `found` can be set to `false` \(line 3\). The iteration in line 4 takes into account both conditions discussed above. As long as there are more nodes to visit and we have not found the item we are looking for, we continue to check the next node. The question in line 5 asks whether the data item is present in the current node. If so, `found` can be set to `true`.

#### remove\(\)

The `remove` method requires two logical steps. Once we find the item \(recall that we assume it is present\), we must remove it. The first step is very similar to `search`. Starting with an external reference set to the head of the list, we traverse the links until we discover the item we are looking for. Since we assume that item is present, we know that the iteration will stop before `current` gets to `null`. This means that we can simply use the boolean `found` in the condition.

When `found` becomes `true`, `current` will be a reference to the node containing the item to be removed. But how do we remove it? One possibility would be to replace the value of the item with some marker that suggests that the item is no longer present. The problem with this approach is the number of nodes will no longer match the number of items. It would be much better to remove the item by removing the entire node.

In order to remove the node containing the item, we need to modify the link in the previous node so that it refers to the node that comes after `current`. Unfortunately, there is no way to go backward in the linked list. Since `current` refers to the node ahead of the node where we would like to make the change, it is too late to make the necessary modification.

The solution to this dilemma is to use two external references as we traverse down the linked list. `current` will behave just as it did before, marking the current location of the traverse. The new reference, which we will call `previous`, will always travel one node behind `current`. That way, when `current` stops at the node to be removed, `previous` will be referring to the proper place in the linked list for the modification.

```js
remove(item) {
    var current = this.head;
    var previous = null;
    var found = false;
    while (!found) {
        if (current.getData() === item) {
            found = true;
        }
        else {
            previous = current;
            current = current.getNext();
        }
    }

    if (previous === null) {
        this.head = current.getNext();
    }
    else {
        previous.setNext(current.getNext());
    }
}
```

Lines 2–3 assign initial values to the two references. Note that `current` starts out at the list head as in the other traversal examples. `previous`, however, is assumed to always travel one node behind current. For this reason, `previous` starts out with a value of `null` since there is no node before the head. The boolean variable `found` will again be used to control the iteration.

In lines 6–7 we ask whether the item stored in the current node is the item we wish to remove. If so, `found` can be set to `true`. If we do not find the item, `previous` and `current` must both be moved one node ahead. Again, the order of these two statements is crucial. `previous` must first be moved one node ahead to the location of `current`. At that point, `current` can be moved. This process is often referred to as "inch-worming" as previous must catch up to `current` before `current` moves ahead. 

Once the searching step of the `remove` has been completed, we need to remove the node from the linked list. However, there is a special case that needs to be addressed. If the item to be removed happens to be the first item in the list, then `current` will reference the first node in the linked list. This also means that `previous` will be `null`. We said earlier that `previous` would be referring to the node whose next reference needs to be modified in order to complete the remove. In this case, it is not `previous` but rather the head of the list that needs to be changed.

Line 15 allows us to check whether we are dealing with the special case described above. If `previous` did not move, it will still have the value `null` when the boolean `found` becomes `true`. In that case \(line 16\) the head of the list is modified to refer to the node after the current node, in effect removing the first node from the linked list. However, if previous is not `null`, the node to be removed is somewhere down the linked list structure. In this case the previous reference is providing us with the node whose next reference must be changed. Line 19 uses the `setNext` method from `previous` to accomplish the removal. Note that in both cases the destination of the reference change is `current.getNext()`. One question that often arises is whether the two cases shown here will also handle the situation where the item to be removed is in the last node of the linked list. We leave that for you to consider.

The remaining methods append, insert, index, and pop are left as exercises. Remember that each of these must take into account whether the change is taking place at the head of the list or someplace else. Also, insert, index, and pop require that we name the positions of the list. We will assume that position names are integers starting with 0.

## 3.5.3 The Ordered List Abstract Data Type

We will now consider a type of list known as an ordered list. For example, if the list of integers shown above were an ordered list \(ascending order\), then it could be written as 17, 26, 31, 54, 77, and 93. Since 17 is the smallest item, it occupies the first position in the list. Likewise, since 93 is the largest, it occupies the last position.

The structure of an ordered list is a collection of items where each item holds a relative position that is based upon some underlying characteristic of the item. The ordering is typically either ascending or descending and we assume that list items have a meaningful comparison operation that is already defined. Many of the ordered list operations are the same as those of the unordered list.

* OrderedList\(\) create a new ordered list that is empty. It needs no parameters and returns an empty list.
* add\(item\) adds a new item to the list making sure that the order is preserved. It needs the item and returns nothing. Assume the item is not already in the list.
* remove\(item\) removes the item from the list. It needs the item and modifies the list. Assume the item is present in the list.
* search\(item\) searches for the item in the list. It needs the item and returns a boolean value.
* isEmpty\(\) tests to see whether the list is empty. It needs no parameters and returns a boolean value.
* size\(\) returns the number of items in the list. It needs no parameters and returns an integer.
* index\(item\) returns the position of item in the list. It needs the item and returns the index. Assume the item is in the list.
* pop\(\) removes and returns the last item in the list. It needs nothing and returns an item. Assume the list has at least one item.
* pop\(pos\) remove and returns the item at position pos. It needs the position and returns the item. Assume the item is in the list.

### 3.5.4 Implementing and ordered list

To implement the `OrderedList` class, we will use the same technique as seen previously with unordered lists. Once again, an empty list will be denoted by a head reference to `null`.

```js
class OrderedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
    }
}
```

As we consider the operations for the ordered list, we should note that the `isEmpty` and `size` methods can be implemented the same as with unordered lists since they deal only with the number of nodes in the list without regard to the actual item values. Likewise, the `remove` method will work just fine since we still need to find the item and then link around the node to remove it. The two remaining methods, `search` and `add`, will require some modification.

#### search\(\)

The search of an unordered linked list required that we traverse the nodes one at a time until we either find the item we are looking for or run out of nodes \(`null`\). It turns out that the same approach would actually work with the ordered list and in fact in the case where we find the item it is exactly what we need. However, in the case where the item is not in the list, we can take advantage of the ordering to stop the search as soon as possible.

```js
search(item) {
    var current = this.head;
    var found = false;
    var stop = false;
    while (current !== null && !found && !stop) {
        if (current.getData() === item) {
            found = true;
        }
        else {
            if (current.getData() > item) {
                stop = true;
            }
            else {
                current = current.getNext();
            }
        }
    }

    return found
}
```

It is easy to incorporate the new condition discussed above by adding another boolean variable, `stop`, and initializing it to `false` \(line 4\). While `stop` is `false` we can continue to look forward in the list \(line 5\). If any node is ever discovered that contains data greater than the item we are looking for, we will set `stop` to `true` \(lines 10–11\). The remaining lines are identical to the unordered list search.

#### add\(\)

The most significant method modification will take place in `add`. Recall that for unordered lists, the `add` method could simply place a new node at the head of the list. It was the easiest point of access. Unfortunately, this will no longer work with ordered lists. It is now necessary that we discover the specific place where a new item belongs in the existing ordered list.

Assume we have the ordered list consisting of 17, 26, 54, 77, and 93 and we want to add the value 31. The `add` method must decide that the new item belongs between 26 and 54. As we explained earlier, we need to traverse the linked list looking for the place where the new node will be added. We know we have found that place when either we run out of nodes \(`current` becomes `null`\) or the value of the current node becomes greater than the item we wish to add.

As we saw with unordered lists, it is necessary to have an additional reference, again called `previous`, since `current` will not provide access to the node that must be modified.

```js
add(item) {
    var current = this.head;
    var previous = null;
    var stop = false;
    while (current !== null && !stop) {
        if (current.getData() > item) {
            stop = false;
        }
        else {
            previous = current;
            current = current.getNext();
        }
    }

    var temp = new Node(item);
    if (previous === null) {
        temp.setNext(this.head);
        this.head = temp;
    }
    else {
        temp.setNext(current);
        previous.setNext(temp);
    }
}
```

Lines 2–3 set up the two external references and lines 10–11 again allow `previous` to follow one node behind `current` every time through the iteration. The condition \(line 5\) allows the iteration to continue as long as there are more nodes and the value in the `current` node is not larger than the item. In either case, when the iteration fails, we have found the location for the new node.

Once a new node has been created for the item, the only remaining question is whether the new node will be added at the beginning of the linked list or some place in the middle. Again, `previous === null` \(line 16\) can be used to provide the answer.

We leave the remaining methods as exercises. You should carefully consider whether the unordered implementations will work given that the list is now ordered.

## 3.5.5 Analysis of Linked Lists

To analyze the complexity of the linked list operations, we need to consider whether they require traversal. Consider a linked list that has $$n$$ nodes. The `isEmpty` method is $$O(1)$$ since it requires one step to check the head reference for `null`. `size`, on the other hand, will always require $$n$$ steps since there is no way to know how many nodes are in the linked list without traversing from head to end so it is $$O(n)$$. Adding an item to an unordered list will always be $$O(1)$$ since we simply place the new node at the head of the linked list. However, `search` and `remove`, as well as `add` for an ordered list, all require the traversal process. Although on average they may need to traverse only half of the nodes, these methods are all $$O(n)$$ since in the worst case each will process every node in the list.
